# Udayy-Task

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Description

- In the project, you can sign-in and then user can browse two websites on the same browser window.
- User can logout itself.

###  Installation

To install all dependencies, Run:

### `yarn add`

###  Command to start app:

### `yarn start`

It will start your development server.

### Usage Instructions:

* Login with your credentials.

##### NOTE: Here we don't have any sign-up functionality because of which we can't use proper log-in functionality. To overcome this, I have just hard-coded the form submit function to redirect user to homepage.To log-in just follow the below innstructions:
1) Enter any random username.
2) Enter any random password.
3) Click "Login" button.
###### It will redirect you to the homepage.

* In navigation bar, there are two input boxes. User can enter urls there two get result in the attached frames below.

##### NOTE: Here we are not using any custom search bar. We are just rendering the input URL in their respective frames. So, due to web security boundations we can't search most of the famous URLs here. 
##### So here are some suggested URLs which you can try:
- http://car.com
- http://bike.com
- http://random.com
- http://chat.com
###### You can try some other random URLs like I mentioned above.

* You can Logout using "Logout" button which is present in the rightmost corner of navigation bar. It will redirect you back to the login page.
